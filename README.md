# Cgolz

**TODO: Add description**

**TODO #2:**
The tests which the program should pass are 
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Version2beta/talks/master/workshops/elixir_automata_and_zombies_2020/cgolz_prototype/test/cgolz_test.exs).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `cgolz` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:cgolz, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/cgolz](https://hexdocs.pm/cgolz).
